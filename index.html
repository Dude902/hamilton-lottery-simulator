    <h1>Hamilton Lottery Simulator</h1>

    <p>
      This simulator assumes 10 pairs of tickets available each night with 50,000 people entering each lottery.
    </p>

    <p>
      For each entry you have a 1 in 5,000 chance of winning.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you enter 3,500 times, you have a ~50% chance of winning at least once.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you enter 23,000 times, you have a ~99% chance of winning at least once.
    </p>
